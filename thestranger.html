        "The Stranger" (French title: "L'Ã‰tranger") is a novel written by the French-Algerian author Albert Camus. Published in 1942, the novel is considered a classic of existentialist literature. Here's a brief summary of "The Stranger":
    
    Plot Summary:
    The story is narrated by Meursault, a detached and emotionally indifferent Algerian who works in Algiers. The novel begins with Meursault learning about the death of his mother. Rather than expressing grief, he appears emotionally detached and is more concerned with the practical aspects of the funeral. This emotional detachment characterizes Meursault throughout the novel.
    
    Meursault's behavior becomes increasingly unusual. He befriends his neighbor, Raymond Sintes, who involves him in a conflict with some Arab men. This conflict eventually leads to a confrontation on the beach, where Meursault, affected by the harsh sunlight and the heat, shoots and kills one of the Arab men without a clear motive.
    
    The novel then shifts to Meursault's trial, where his indifference and lack of remorse become focal points. The legal system and society, represented by the court, find Meursault's emotional detachment and refusal to conform to societal expectations troubling. The trial becomes more about Meursault's character than the actual crime.
    
    The novel explores themes of existentialism, absurdism, and the meaninglessness of life. Meursault's inability to conform to societal norms and his disinterest in adhering to conventional moral standards make him an outsider ("The Stranger") in the society in which he live
